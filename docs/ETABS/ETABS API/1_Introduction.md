### **What is ETABS?**  
**ETABS** is a leading software used for structural analysis and design of buildings, bridges, and other structures. It's widely used by engineers to model, analyze, and design a variety of structures. üèóÔ∏è

### **What is the ETABS API?**  
The **ETABS API** allows users to control ETABS programmatically using programming languages like **Python** üêç. This lets you automate tasks such as creating models, assigning loads, running analyses, and extracting results, without manual input. ü§ñ


### **How the ETABS API Works**


:::info **NOTICE:** *If you're already familiar with how APIs work and just want to jump into practical examples, feel free to skip this section and proceed to the next one. Otherwise, let's take a quick look at how the ETABS API functions behind the scenes.*  
:::

The **ETABS API** acts as a bridge between Python and the ETABS software, allowing Python scripts to interact with ETABS and automate various tasks. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **COM Interface**:  
   The API uses **COM (Component Object Model)**, a Microsoft technology that enables communication between different software programs. Python communicates with ETABS using this interface, which acts as a bridge for commands and data exchange. 

2. **ETABS Object**:  
   When you start a Python script, it creates an **ETABS object**. This object is your connection to the running ETABS program, allowing you to control ETABS like a "remote control." 

3. **Sending Commands**:  
   After the connection is established, you can send commands to ETABS, such as creating a new model, defining grid systems, assigning loads, or running analyses. ETABS performs these actions and sends responses back to Python.

4. **Data Access**:  
   Through the API, Python can access and modify data inside ETABS, including model parameters, materials, sections, and analysis results. This allows for easy automation and integration with other tools or processes.
